A data science module on IoT that I took while as a year 4 undergraduate at the National University Of Singapore (NUS). Key topics include Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Neural Networks & IoT Systems, and a final Data Science Project to forecast data gathered from an actual IoT system in Singapore from 2018-2022.
